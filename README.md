### GloVe word vectors - embedding space

This is an additional content to my upcoming master thesis. I am researching ethical use of word embeddings, and decided to create an example notebook, so that anyone who is interested can "play around" with the embedding and get a sense of how it works. 

The text file containing the word vectors can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/anindya2906/glove6b

I used the 50-dimensional vectors, for parctical reasons, however higher dimensional vectors can also be downloaded from the above link. They encode more information but require more space and computing.
